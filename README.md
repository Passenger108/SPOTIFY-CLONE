## Overview
This is a simple **Music Player Web App** that allows users to play, pause, and navigate through a playlist of songs. The project is built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** and provides an interactive user interface.

## Features

- **Playlist Support**: Users can select songs from a predefined playlist.
- **Progress Bar**: Displays the current playback position.
- **Responsive Design**: Works on both desktop and mobile devices.

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/music-player.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```
3. Open `index.html` in a browser to run the app.
