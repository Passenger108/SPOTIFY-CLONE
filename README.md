# Music Player Web App

## Overview
This is a simple **Music Player Web App** that allows users to play, pause, and navigate through a playlist of songs. The project is built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** and provides an interactive user interface.

## Features
- **Play/Pause Music**: Click the play button to start or stop the music.
- **Playlist Support**: Users can select songs from a predefined playlist.
- **Progress Bar**: Displays the current playback position.


## Tech Stack
- **HTML**: Structure of the web application.
- **CSS**: Styling for the UI.
- **JavaScript**: Controls the music playback functionality.

## Installation & Usage
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/Passenger108/SPOTIFY-CLONE.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```sh
   cd SPOTIFY-CLONE
   ```
3. Open `index.html` in a browser to run the app.

## File Structure
```
/music-player
│── index.html  # Main HTML file
│── style.css   # Stylesheet
│── script.js   # JavaScript logic
│── *    # Contains audio files & images
```

## How It Works
1. **JavaScript** is used to handle play/pause functionality.
2. An **event listener** is added to elements for user interaction.
3. **Audio API** is used to control song playback.

## Future Improvements
- Implement a **song shuffle** feature.
- Integrate a **backend** for dynamic song storage.
